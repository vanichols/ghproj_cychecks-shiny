*x-axis*

A value of 0 (dotted line) indicates being female does not affect the base salary of that position in a given department/year. A positive value indicates a pay bump with being female, a negative value indicates a pay cut. If there is only one gender represented, the value defaults to 0 (perfectly equal).

*y-axis*

A perfectly geneder-balanced department would have 50% male and 50% female faculty in every position (dotted line).

*size of point*

The total number of faculty in that position for a given department/year is represented by the area of the point size. 

*hover*

Hovering over a point will provide exact values for gender representation and pay equality metrics. You can also select a window to zoom into; to escape the zoomed area double click anywhere on the plot. 

*weird legend*

Seems to be a side effect of using plotly, which lets you use the hover function. (?)
