*salary types*

**Base salaries (top panels)** represent what the state pays the faculty, and does not include salary earned through grants. Some faculty may have 9-month appointments compared to others with a 12-month, so directly comparing base salaries may not always be fair, but in many cases it is appropriate to compare salaries within a position. 

**Total salaries (middel panels)** may include grant money or payments of other types. We don't really get it. 

**Travel (bottom panels)** only represents money the state supplies to support travel. We also don't really get this one. 

*y-axis*

A perfectly geneder-balanced department would have 50% male and 50% female faculty in every position (dotted line). 

*hover*

Hovering over a point will provide the name of the faculty their gender, and their salary. 

*weird legend*

Seems to be a side effect of using plotly, which lets you use the hover function. (?)
