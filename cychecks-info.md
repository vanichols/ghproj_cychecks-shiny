# CyChecks2

**Overview**

The goal of CyChecks is to provide visualizations of Iowa State University (the **Cy**clones) faculty salaries (their **Checks**).

We hope this can help:

1.  Aid job seekers in negotiating starting salaries.
2.  Shed light on possible pay inequities with respect to gender.
3.  Identify positions that are lacking gender diversity.

**Background**

The state of Iowa offers a large amount of public data at [this site](https://data.iowa.gov/). You can access the data with or without an API token, but can sign up for one [here](https://dev.socrata.com/foundry/data.iowa.gov/s3p7-wy6w). 

Iowa state employee salaries are available at [this site](https://data.iowa.gov/State-Finances/State-of-Iowa-Salary-Book/s3p7-wy6w). The data from this site does not include the employee's home department. Unfortunately, to our knowledge the data linking names to departments is not easily accessible. ISU's Human Resources Department kindly provided a snapshot of employees with their home departments and associated colleges for valid on January 1 of each year for 2012-2019. 

**Who to Blame**

[Lydia English](https://lydiae.com/) and [Gina Nichols](https://vanichols.netlify.app/) created the package and Shiny visualization tool with the help of [Jarad Niemi](https://www.jarad.me/). They plan to maintain the salary database as long as Human Resources fields their email requests for department affiliations. This package is based on a project, CyChecks, developed for Stat 585 with Heike Hoffman, and we are grateful for the work of the original team members for that project including Yones, Brianna, and Stephanie.
